# Project Overview - Temperature Change

This is a project  from data science bootcamp of big blue data academy.The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize the rise and change of temperature over time for countries and continents, which will be combined with some factors such as Co2.The datasets used in this project are as follows:
- Temperature Change Dataset: This dataset provides historical temperature records from various sources.
- CO2 Dataset: This dataset contains historical CO2 emissions data from different regions.

# Files
The project consists of the following files:

Temperaure_Change.pbix: The Power BI file containing the visualizations, data model, and report for the analysis.
temperature_change.csv: The CSV file containing the temperature change data.
co2_emissions.csv: The CSV file containing the CO2 emissions data.
Temperaure_Change_Report: The Pdf file containing the visualizations
